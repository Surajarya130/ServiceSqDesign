        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="dummyContainer">
            <p>Cleaning a cluttered home is like pouring nectar in a sieve. It is a near wasted effort.</p>
            <p>And so much of time goes in arranging and cleaning the pile of things.</p>
            <p>When you declutter, you eliminate the excess baggage that serve no purpose. In fact, clutter adds to your stress levels.</p>
            <p>As you travel down the path of decluttering and removing excess stuff from your life, you begin to see how much calmer your home feels.</p>
            <p>And your home retains the clean look with minimal effort. <br>
            However, to declutter, you need a shift in mindset and perspective – to fight against the cultural message that the things you own define your success, that who you are and what you have will never be enough.</p>
            <p>In simple terms, by minimising your possessions, you maximize your life. That’s why there is truth to the saying – Less is More.</p>

                    <h2>Why Declutter? </h2>
                    <p>A tidy, clean home is a joy to live in. That joy has a way of spreading calmness and peace all around.</p>
                    <p>But….. Despite all the cleaning we do in our homes, it becomes messy again, soon enough. And the untidy look returns. </p>
                    <p>The fault does not lie in the lack of effort in cleaning. The untidiness is a reflection of the amount of clutter in our homes.</p>
                    <p>The importance of decluttering and minimalism as a way of life, is underestimated by most people. When we own more than we need, it adds to the clutter at home and creates an untidy look. Besides, we waste our finite resource – time – in maintaining our stuff. </p>
                    <p>Living in an uncluttered home, with an uncluttered mind, can save you 15+ hours every month and get you to a state of flow. <br>
                        Decluttering is the action that leads you to adopt a lifestyle of Minimalism. Where Less is More.
                    </p>
                    <p>Minimalism is less about the things you remove and more about the things you add – to the quality of your life.</p>

        <h2>Designing a Minimalist Home</h2>
        <p>We can also help you introduce elements of Minimalism to the interiors you live in. We love to do up a home designed along the lines of minimalism, with lots of natural light and simple, comfortable furnishings. The palette that we prefer to use is mostly monochromatic and colour is used as an accent. Our Minimalist designs aim at functionality, space optimization, free flow of air and graceful elegance. Once your home is designed this way, it will usher in an atmosphere of serenity. It will be an inviting space that has timeless aesthetic.</p>
        <p>Most of our services are done in-house. Our vertical – Interiors Square (www.interiorssquare.com) – focuses exclusively on Interior Designing and Renovation Services. Painting Square (www.paintingsquare.com), another division of ours, handles painting services. Decluttering and deep cleaning are what our parent organization, Service Square <a href="www.servicesquare.com">(www.servicesquare.com)</a> specializes in.</p>
        <p>We also believe that there is no ‘one solution’ to a design problem. A space can have multiple design solutions depending on the uniqueness of each space and depending on the user’s needs. Hence, we put in a lot of effort to understand your needs and functions of every item and propose solutions for all spaces, requirements and budgets. <br>
            Adopting this lifestyle takes you on a journey – perhaps beginning with decluttering your closet or your entire home, then a certain aspect of your life, or even your daily schedule.
        </p>
        <p>This journey has the potential to help you find what really matters in life.</p>

        <p>You can do the math to know how many hours you could be losing every month to things that do not add value. </p>
        <p>Statistics show that getting rid of clutter eliminates up to 40% of housework.</p>
        <p>And, women’s stress levels are directly proportional to the amount of stuff in their home.</p>
        <p>Studies also show that 50 per cent of executives would save minimum 30 minutes to 1 hour daily in an organized place.</p>
        <p>Studies have proven that a decluttered and well organised home –following the principles of minimalism - can save you 15+ hours a month...!</p>
        <p>There is a way to break free of the clutter – to make your home reveal a clean, elegant look always. Decluttering is t  he smart way to a permanently elegant, clean home.</p>

        <p>This is how you naturally progress towards minimalism, treasuring the things you really love or value and discarding things that you do not need or cherish.  You will then marvel how Less is actually More. And how simplicity and order bring freedom and balance in your home and your mind. Then you will see the emergence of a peaceful home without clutter and mess all over the place.</p>
        <p>When you maintain decluttering and removing excess from your life as a ritual, a shift in perspective invariably happens, which will lead to life style changes, affecting the way you think and behave – rather than changes that only create better outward appearances.</p>
